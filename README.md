## FLEET RENTAL DEMO CODE

**Original Fleet Rental Design**
FleetRental is a fictitious car rental business that caters to high-end clients interested in renting high-performance and exotic cars. Cars such as Dodge Viper, Ford GT50, Lotus Elise, 911 Porsche, and Mercedes M3 are some of the cars that are offered initially. 

Based on marketing studies, only major U.S., cities will host this business, which includes New York, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and Denver, the company HQ, will be first city where this is available as a pilot.

During the pilot phase of this application it will be built as a windows based fat-client used by customer support reps (CSRs). In this phase, all orders will be placed via CSRs. This implies that inventory browsing, rental rate info will only be conveyed by the CSR. 

Future implementation will make the application web enabled.
